# Production Tracker Project

* What is this project?
	* This is a production tracker project that was built using JavaFX and focused on utilizing H2 databases to store values entered by employees. Employees are allowed to store products into these databases and produce an updated production log if a change occurs. Coding style used for this program was object oriented with its focus on inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. (4 pillars)
* Who made this project?
	* Author: William Angola
	* Created independently with some tips and hints from: TA's, Professor, and class mates.
* When did you make it?
	* This was made through out my fall semester in 2020,  as a Junior I felt slightly experienced when starting this project but after multiple errors and learning of concepts I can gracefully say I am moderately experienced. You can always learn something new.
* Why did you make it?
	* This was made as a semester long project which had it's ups and downs of productivity. This project reflects me as a person who focuses too much on functionality and not enough on colors and display, which I need to work on. It taught me how to deal with programming frustration with meditation and question/write up logical steps rather than jumping right in.
* Where did you make it?
	* Thankfully in the comfort of my own home due to covid, but the university I attend is Florida Gulf Coast University. This project was assigned in my COP 3003 Object Oriented Programming course.
